# Real-Time Detection Using Flask and OpenCV (Haarcascade)

## Project Summary

This project is a real-time video stream detection application built using Flask and OpenCV. The application captures video from a phone camera or laptop webcam and processes it using pre-trained Haarcascade classifiers. It detects human faces, eyes, smiles, and cat faces in the video feed. The processed video stream, with detection overlays, is then rendered in a simple web interface. The application is lightweight, runs on local devices, and is intended for live video processing through a web browser.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use OpenCVâ€™s Haarcascade classifiers for real-time object detection in video streams and to integrate this functionality into a web application using Flask. This project can serve as a foundation for further development into more complex computer vision applications like security monitoring, facial recognition, or custom object detection models.

### Key Objectives

- Real-time face, eye, smile, and cat face detection from video streams.
- Integration of OpenCV with Flask for serving live video to a web interface.
- Demonstrating the use of Haarcascade classifiers for object detection.
- Providing an easy-to-use template for deploying computer vision applications on the web.
